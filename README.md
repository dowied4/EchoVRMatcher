# EchoVR Matcher
This is made to connect players faster as the default way of using your friends list is very slow and unreliable. EchoVR Matcher is a way of directly connecting spectators or players to specific matches with no need to way for invites.

## Usage
To be able to fetch an id you need to run the exe with -http flag. Hitting launch without having anything in the matchID field will launch the game with this field.

## Installation
To be able to use the package directly you need two external packages using pip:

```bash
pip install PyQt5
pip install echovr-api
```
